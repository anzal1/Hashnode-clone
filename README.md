Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/anzal/Hashnode-clone
```

At the root of your project create an .env file with the following contents:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MONGODBURI=<YOUR_MONGODB_URL>
JWT_SECRET=<SECRET_FOR_JWT>
cloud_name=<CLOUNDINARY_NAME>

Then run `yarn` and `yarn d` to see the hashnode clone in action.

I hope you liked this project. If you do then don't forget to give this repo a star
